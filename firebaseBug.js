The Firebase Authentication SDK may throw an error if the user's email address or password is invalid or if the user is not authorized to access the requested resource. The error messages returned by the SDK can be cryptic, making it difficult to diagnose the root cause of the problem.  For example, a generic "auth/invalid-email" error may be due to an incorrect email format or a missing '@' symbol, or simply a user who doesn't exist. Similarly, an "auth/user-disabled" error doesn't always clearly state if the user has been explicitly disabled, or if there are issues with the Firebase project's configuration. Another less common scenario is an unexpected behavior in the Authentication SDK when dealing with multiple concurrent requests or when integrating it with other Firebase services, leading to race conditions or data inconsistencies. This may manifest as unexpected login or sign-up failures without clear error messages.
